Issue #14 -- Real Integration -- app/services/metrics_service.py

NEW FILE (flagged in PR Notes -- not present in Issue #10's scaffold).

Why this exists: Issue #14 requires /model-metrics to return real
values from evaluation/model_comparison.md (Latifah, Issue #11). That
file is a human-readable Markdown report, not structured data (no
`evaluation/model_comparison.json` or similar was produced by #11).
Per the issue's own instructions -- "Coordinate with Latifah to update
[the artifact], or add a thin adapter layer in the API" -- this is
that adapter, since editing #11's artifact format is out of scope for
this PR and out of this contributor's ownership.

This module ONLY reads app/schemas' locked metric names -- accuracy,
precision, recall, roc_auc -- to keep /model-metrics' response shape
identical to Issue #10 (see routes.py's original placeholder, which
returned exactly these four keys). confusion_matrix and per-model rows
are intentionally not exposed here, since adding them would change the
endpoint's response shape, which Issue #14 explicitly forbids without
cross-team confirmation (Project_Specification.md, section 4).

NOTE FOR REVIEWERS: this parses the "### Performance" section under
"## Selected Model" in model_comparison.md. If Latifah's report format
changes, this parser breaks. Recommend Issue #11 (or a follow-up)
produce a structured evaluation/model_comparison.json alongside the
Markdown report, so this regex-based parsing can be replaced with a
plain json.load(). Flagging rather than silently living with the
fragility.
