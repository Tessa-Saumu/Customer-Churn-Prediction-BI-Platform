# Repository Structure

This document is the authoritative, complete reference for how this repository is organized. It reflects the actual final state of `main` as of the Issue #20 integration and cleanup pass, verified directly against the repository's real file tree — not the plan, not an earlier draft.

For a shorter, narrative summary of the structure aimed at someone just getting started, see `README.md`'s "Repository Structure" section. This document is the detailed, complete counterpart to that summary.

> **Note:** a few paths below are gitignored and won't appear in a fresh `git clone` until you run the relevant pipeline step — these are marked explicitly. `data/raw/telco_churn_raw.csv`, `database/churn.db`, and `models/best_model.pkl` fall into this category; see `README.md`'s "Running the Project" section for how to generate them locally.

## Notes on Specific Directories

### `schemas/` vs `app/schemas/`
There are two `schemas/` directories in this repo, and this is intentional but worth being explicit about: the root-level `schemas/` contains only a `.gitkeep` placeholder and is not used. The real Pydantic request/response models live in `app/schemas/customer_schema.py`. If you're looking for the API's schema definitions, go to `app/schemas/`, not the root `schemas/` folder.

### `app/models/`
Present in the original scaffold as a placeholder for model-related classes, but the actual persisted model artifact lives at `models/best_model.pkl` (repo root), and the SQLAlchemy ORM model lives at `database/models.py`. `app/models/` is not currently populated.

### Two `predict.py` files
- **`predict.py` (repo root)** is the real, production entry point — this is what `app/api/routes.py` imports and calls. It includes the Issue #14 adapter layer that translates the API's field names (`tenure`, `SeniorCitizen`, etc.) into the training pipeline's column names (`tenure_months`, `senior_citizen`, etc.).
- **`training/predict.py`** is an earlier, superseded version without that adapter layer. It is not imported anywhere under `app/` — confirmed by a live regression test (`tests/test_models.py::TestTrainingPredictDeprecationFlag`) that fails loudly if this ever changes. See `docs/qa_findings.md` Finding 9 for the full history. A team decision on whether to delete this file or formally mark it as reference-only is still open as of this document.

### Gitignored paths you'll need to generate locally
These exist conceptually in the project but are intentionally excluded from version control (see `.gitignore`):
- `data/raw/telco_churn_raw.csv` — place the real downloaded dataset here.
- `database/churn.db` — generated by `python database/init_db.py && python etl/load_to_db.py && python database/init_views.py`.
- `models/best_model.pkl` — generated by `python training/evaluate_models.py`.

See `README.md`'s "Running the Project" section for the full, ordered setup sequence.

## Source

This document was generated directly from the actual repository file listing as of the Issue #20 integration/cleanup pass, cross-checked against `README.md`, `Project_Specification.md`, and `docs/qa_findings.md`. If the structure changes in future work, update this file alongside the change — it's meant to stay accurate, not become another stale reference document.
