Issue #17 -- Model Training & Prediction Testing -- tests/test_models.py

Owner: Theresia --
authored entirely from scratch, no content carried over from
Latifah's (#11) implementation.

Which predict() this file tests
--------------------------------
Two prediction modules exist in this codebase:

    1. predict.py (repo root)      -- Latifah's Issue #11 contract,
       later wrapped by Praise's Issue #14 field-adapter. This is the
       one app/api/routes.py actually imports and calls. Per
       Project_Specification.md section 4, this is the locked
       interface: predict(customer_data: dict) -> {"churn_probability":
       float, "churn_prediction": bool}.

    2. training/predict.py          -- an earlier/simpler module with
       the same function name and a near-identical body, but WITHOUT
       the API-field-name adapter. It is not imported anywhere in
       app/ (confirmed by inspection: app/api/routes.py imports only
       from repo-root predict.py). This looks like a leftover/
       superseded duplicate rather than a second, intentionally
       maintained interface.

This file tests repo-root predict.py as the primary, locked contract,
since that's what production actually calls. A dedicated test in the
"deprecation flag" section below asserts training/predict.py is not
imported anywhere under app/, so if someone later starts depending on
it, this test fails loudly rather than the duplication silently
persisting or drifting further from the real contract. This is
flagged in docs/qa_findings.md as a question for Latifah/Theresia to
resolve (delete training/predict.py, or clarify its purpose) -- not
resolved unilaterally in this PR.

Structure
---------
    1. UNIT TESTS       (@pytest.mark.unit)
       Model-artifact loading, predict() baseline correctness and
       edge cases, and the training/predict.py deprecation-flag check.
       These need models/best_model.pkl to exist on disk (an artifact
       load, not a network/DB call), which is why they're grouped as
       "unit" here rather than requiring a live service the way the
       API/DB tests do -- consistent with tests/test_etl.py and
       tests/test_api.py's definition of unit vs. integration for
       this repo (see each file's own module docstring).

    2. INTEGRATION TESTS (@pytest.mark.integration)
       Runs the real training/evaluate_models.py pipeline end-to-end
       against the real (test-run) database, then confirms the
       resulting artifact and evaluation report satisfy the same
       checks -- exercising the full training -> artifact ->
       prediction path in one go, not just a pre-existing pickle.
       This is slow (trains 5 real models) and is marked accordingly;
       CI can run `pytest tests/test_models.py -m "not integration"`
       for a fast pass if needed.

Run everything:            pytest tests/test_models.py
Run only unit tests:       pytest tests/test_models.py -m unit
Run only integration:      pytest tests/test_models.py -m integration
